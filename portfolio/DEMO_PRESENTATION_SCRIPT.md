*"Market making is one of the most sophisticated HFT strategies. Let me show you how I implemented professional-grade market making with inventory management."*

**Code Walkthrough** (show key snippets):
```python
class MarketMakingStrategy(BaseStrategy):
    def calculate_optimal_spread(self, snapshot: BookSnapshot) -> float:
        # Adjust for volatility, competition, and inventory
        spread = self.config.target_spread
        spread *= (1 + self.volatility_estimate * 2)  # Volatility adjustment
        spread *= (1 - self.competition_pressure * 0.3)  # Competition
        return max(self.config.min_spread, spread)
```
