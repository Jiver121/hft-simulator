### 🔧 Technical Implementation Details

#### Enhanced Vectorized Matching
```python
def _match_market_order_optimized(self, order: Order) -> List[Trade]:
    # Proper data type handling to prevent overflow
    cumulative_volume = np.cumsum(valid_volumes, dtype=np.int64)
    levels_needed = np.searchsorted(cumulative_volume, remaining_volume)
    
    # Vectorized trade creation with memory pooling
    for price, volume in trades_data:
        trade = self._create_trade_pooled(order, price, volume)
```

#### Memory Pooling Implementation
```python
def _create_trade_pooled(self, order: Order, price: float, volume: int) -> Trade:
    with self._pool_lock:
        if not self._trade_pool.empty():
            trade = self._trade_pool.get_nowait()
            # Reuse existing trade object
            self.stats['memory_pool_hits'] += 1
```

#### Vectorized Cleanup Operations
```python
def _cleanup_empty_levels_vectorized(self) -> None:
    # Use boolean indexing for efficient array compression
    non_empty_mask = bid_volumes_slice > 0
    valid_count = np.sum(non_empty_mask)
    # Vectorized array compaction
```

### 🚀 Performance Benefits
